I'd like to confess something. I've talked about the joys of reading
on this blog
[before](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/02/10/how-much-do-you-read.html). I've
given book recommendations; I've discussed how various books have
really helped me; basically, I'm very pro-reading about CS.

And yet? I totally suck at it. I can count the number of CS books I've
actually read, cover to cover in one hand. I constantly pick up a
book, read it for a few pages and toss it away. I've bought a
ridiculous amount of books and read way way fewer of them.

That said, the haphazard snippets of reading that I've managed to eek
out in between my agitated switching between different tasks (watching
me work is like watching someone try to eat three different meals at
the same time) have still benefited me significantly. I've taken
extremely valuable lessons from books I don't think I'll ever
finish. I've learned immense amounts from blog posts where I skim the
last half. One of my most successful, impressive projects still barely
works.

This is all fine. Sure, I'd love to have finished the Art of
Surveillance Capitalism, especially after having brought it up in
literally every conversation. Sure, I should really get back to the
Cornell compilers class of which I've watched two lectures. Sure, I
should really refactor my compiler to have an actual intermediate
representation.

But it's okay if I don't do these things. It's okay if I learn in an
imperfect, incomplete manner.

In school it's different. School is based on checkpoints and
gateways. By passing Analysis, you've signified that you know Analysis
and that you are trusted with going on to the next math class.

This has some justification in school. Schools fundamentally mint
credentials and credentials---at least in theory---require a
consistent minimum amount of knowledge.

Of course it's very unlikely that students actually get
consistency. Professors teach differently; courses get shuffled;
pandemics happen. But that's the theory.

However you don't have to follow that model. You don't have to
complete Analysis. You don't have to finish the book. Hell, go ahead,
skip the rest of this blog post. You've still learned something.

# Wandering vs Commuting

Let's add a metaphor. School is like commuting. You're setting out on
an established path to an established destination. If you get detoured
or if you can't complete a leg of your journey, that's a big problem.

But that's not the only way to travel. Have you ever gotten on a
subway, just to see where it goes? Or walked around a city, taking
turns at random? It's quite nice. You don't have to complete any
journey or reach any destination. There's no stressing over subway
delays. You can just discover.

Imagine how stupid it'd be if you tried to use Google Maps directions
to wander. What's the point?

# Depth First

The joy of wandering is in the discoveries you make. You can find a
neat cheese shop or a very cool little park. When you're in need of
very good cheese or a quiet place to read, you can refer back to these
locations.

In the same way, learning imperfectly loads your brain with various
possible references. You could be trying to write a sudoku solver and
remember that time you briefly skimmed The Art of Computer Programming
(TAOCP) Volume 4, Fascicle 5: Mathematical Preliminaries Redux;
Backtracking; Dancing Links[^1] and read something about Sudoku being an
exact cover problem. Or you could be facing an offer deadline of a
week and recall [that blog
post](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/11/26/exploding-offer-season/)
by Joel Spolsky that you glossed over.

[^1]: A hilarious title, but also surprisingly readable.

Put in lingua patria, learning imperfectly is a depth first
search. You can gain a lay of the land, then come back to the relevant
area when you need to actually learn it in depth.

# Everything Is Imperfect

I'll let you in on a secret though. After a certain point, all
learning is imperfect. Even if you do read the whole book or complete
the class or get the degree, you're not gonna remember everything. And
besides, the course/book/degree only provides a small, shallow,
incomplete view into the field. You're never going to learn enough in
the field. There's this wonderful [visualization of a
PhD](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/) that
explains how getting a PhD requires pushing at the boundary of human
knowledge and making the tinest little puncture.

The side effect of that tiny puncture is that it's really impossible
to form a complete picture. Learning is about managing to form some
sort of comprehension out of an imperfect set of data.

Go read a couple pages of CLRS and get bored. Go try to read Knuth
and fail (I currently have a copy of TAOCP: Volume 3 on my desk of
which I've read maybe 3 pages). Skim a few blog posts. It'll only help
you.

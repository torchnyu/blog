Too many people worry about problems that aren't really problems.

Specifically, they worry about problems that are good problems to
have. They're worrying about applying to internships because they also
want to do research and undergrad research programs have applications
that open much later than internships. They're worrying about how
they'll move to a different city if they get the job. They're worrying
about whether or not they're prepared for the interview when they
apply.

These are all wonderful problems to have. If you end up having to
decide between an offer and a potential research position, that's a
great situation to be in. It's certainly a lot better than not
applying to internships, then not getting a research position and
having to spend your summer twiddling your thumbs.

And besides, it's not like these problems are imminent. You haven't
gotten the job yet. You haven't gotten the interview. Once you get
close, you can start worrying.

There's a common idea in algorithms that when you come to a choice,
you take both options. The most famous instance of this idea is in
non-deterministic Turing machines. Turing machines are basically an
extremely simple model of a computer. It has an unlimited tape of
memory which it can read from and navigate through. Based on the
current location of the tape, the machine can decide to do something.

Non-deterministic Turing machines are neat because they can decide to
do multiple things. In a sense, you can imagine the machine, at a
decision point, cloning itself into a bunch of other machines, each of
which go down a path. If one of the clones succeeds, then the machine
succeeds.

Anyways, this is looking a little too much like actual computer
science and we wouldn't want that, would we. My point is that it's
good to have options. Too often we see choices as either/or. You
either stay at the same school or you transfer. You choose the
research position or the job. That may be true in the end, but that
doesn't mean you should cut off these options early.

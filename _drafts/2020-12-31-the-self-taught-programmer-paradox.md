title:  "The Self Taught Programmer Paradox"

I have a problem with the phrase "self taught programmer". It's not
that I take issue with autodidacts. Far from it; I find the phrase
redundant. Every programmmer is a self taught programmer.

Some of us may take courses in school and may learn to write code
under the guidance of [a
brilliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman),
[at-times eccentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Felleisen)
[professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Malan). Others
might learn via after school programs or online courses. But the nice
guided path of professors and courses never lasts. Eventually, whether
for work or for personal interest, you have to teach yourself.

This is true to an extent with all fields. Laws change; medicine
evolves; engineering techniques improve. But programming is unique in
a few ways. It's unique in the speed and intensity of its
evolution. New libraries, new languages, new paradigms seem to pop up
every week. Programming is also a field where schools don't teach the
precise skills necessary to be a programmer. Most CS students
graduate, for better or for worse, as fairly incompetent
developers. This isn't their fault. Schools simply don't teach
software development workflows, agile, deployment techniques, software
architecture, visual design, object oriented patterns, etc. Nor should
they. Because software evolves constantly, it's impractical to teach
it. One year's cutting edge code is another year's outdated legacy.

At some point in your development career, you will have to
teach yourself. The earlier you accept that, the better you will
do. On the flip side, if you don't like teaching yourself, then you
will not have a great time as a programmer.

I've repeated again and again and again that courses aren't enough at
NYU. I've said this because yes, NYU does have lackluster CS courses,
but even at a school with the most comprehensive curriculum this would
still be true. You will not learn enough in school.

Some may respond that I'm merely a youngster echoing a sentiment
specific to web development, an area bursting with other young,
overeager programmers. I'll concede that web development does have an
unusually high rate of churn and that not all areas of programming
necessarily require you to perpetually teach yourself. But even the
most stagnant of the stagnant require some self teaching. Even if you
decide to learn COBOL and spend your life maintaining 50 year old
codebases, you'll still have to teach yourself COBOL! NYU doesn't
offer a class in it.

Self teaching isn't like learning in school either. I don't learn by
doing homework, by studying for tests or by listening to lectures. I
learned by doing. I learned compilers by building a compiler. I
learned web development by building a web app. Whenever I've tried to
learn something solely by reading a book or a tutorial, I've
failed. Inevitably I need to make something.

It's okay if you're bad at self learning by the way. A lot of people
have never been taught how to learn on their own. It may seem daunting
to teach yourself without any structure, without a syllabus or
assignments. But it's also freeing. You don't have to learn at any
particular pace. You can breeze through topics or abandon them at
will. You can learn out of order or [learn
imperfectly](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2021/01/20/learn-imperfectly.html). It's
all okay.

This is also why, paradoxically, the best CS teachers are those who
know when not to teach. I took a software development course in high
school. The teacher would give us lessons on some core concepts, but
he also would teach by showing us where we could find information, and
letting us figure it out ourselves.

Surprisingly, this isn't another complaining post. Instead, let's
answer an incredibly common question: how the heck do Courant, CAS,
the CS department relate to each other?

**NOTE**: This is correct as of December 2020. Except it might not
be. This is convoluted and confusing enough that it's unlikely to be
fully correct. Please verify this info on your own.

Let's start with Courant. The Courant Institute of Mathematical
Sciences is, well, an institute of mathematical sciences. Courant is
primarily known for its applied and theoretical math, but it also
contains computer science.

The director of Courant, Russ Caflisch, is effectively a dean. He
reports to the NYU president directly.

The CS department used to be part of the Faculty of Arts & Sciences
(FAS) in that the tenure process would go through FAS, while the math
department followed Courant guidelines for tenure. Somewhere along the
line, NYU decided to simplify this process and make CS also under
Courant. Therefore the tenure process goes through Courant and not
FAS.

The College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) is where undergraduates are
enrolled and is the institution that grants undergraduates
degrees. Its graduate equivalent is the Graduate School of Arts and
Sciences (GSAS).

When you take courses as a CAS CS major, you are taking Courant CS
courses. Courant gets a certain amount of money per student from
CAS. This is relatively new. Courant used to get money from defense[^1]
grants, but that ran dry.

[^1]: At one point during the Vietnam War, protesters put an
    improvised explosive near a supercomputer in Courant. Peter Lax,
    one of Courant's most highly regarded mathematicians, actually
    disabled the explosive with the help of a few others. You can read
    about it

What's also interesting is that because the CS department is in
Courant, professors who work at other institutes, such as the Center
for Data Science (CDS), are still Courant faculty. This often means
you'll see that a professor is associated with CDS but appointed to
Courant CS.

Tandon CS is not CAS CS. This may seem like a vacuous statement, but
it's not because the Tandon and CAS math departments merged
in 2017. This took a lot of effort and it's unclear if CS will
follow. There's a lot of logistical concerns with merging the
departments, but it would simplify degree requirements and consolidate
classes. I have a post on this precise issue that may be published
soon.

With math, both Tandon students and CAS students take classes from the
Courant math department. Students receive their degree from their
respective schools and have different sets of requirements. For the
first two years of Tandon math, students take Tandon specific
courses. Past that point, there aren't really that many advanced math
courses specific to Tandon, so they take cross-listed CAS/Tandon math
courses.

You may ask, why is it that Tandon has a separate CS program from CAS?
It's a good question. A lot of schools don't actually have separate CS
degrees for engineering versus Arts & Sciences. They have one degree
with then additional engineering or Arts & Sciences requirements
tacked on. There's a few reasons. For one, Tandon is a relatively new
part of NYU, having joined in 2014. The other reason is that Tandon
makes money off of their programs. Again, funding is tied to students
in each respective program. If Tandon were to nix programs, it would
lose money.

If you want a confusing summary, *technically* Courant doesn't have
students and CAS doesn't have a CS department.
